# MAGIC # De-Duping Data Lab
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this exercise, we're doing ETL on a file we've received from a customer. That file contains data about people, including:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * first, middle and last names
# MAGIC * gender
# MAGIC * birth date
# MAGIC * Social Security number
# MAGIC * salary
# MAGIC
# MAGIC But, as is unfortunately common in data we get from this customer, the file contains some duplicate records. Worse:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * In some of the records, the names are mixed case (e.g., "Carol"), while in others, they are uppercase (e.g., "CAROL").
# MAGIC * The Social Security numbers aren't consistent either. Some of them are hyphenated (e.g., "992-83-4829"), while others are missing hyphens ("992834829").
# MAGIC
# MAGIC If all of the name fields match -- if you disregard character case -- then the birth dates and salaries are guaranteed to match as well,
# MAGIC and the Social Security Numbers *would* match if they were somehow put in the same format.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Your job is to remove the duplicate records. The specific requirements of your job are:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Remove duplicates. It doesn't matter which record you keep; it only matters that you keep one of them.
# MAGIC * Preserve the data format of the columns. For example, if you write the first name column in all lowercase, you haven't met this requirement.

# MAGIC <img src="https://files.training.databricks.com/images/icon_hint_32.png" alt="Hint"> The initial dataset contains 103,000 records.
# MAGIC The de-duplicated result has 100,000 records.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Next, write the results in **Delta** format as a **single data file** to the directory given by the variable **delta_dest_dir**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC <img src="https://files.training.databricks.com/images/icon_hint_32.png" alt="Hint"> Remember the relationship between the number of partitions in a DataFrame and the number of files written.
